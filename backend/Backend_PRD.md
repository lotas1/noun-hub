# NounHub Backend Product Requirements Document

*Product Managers: Marty Cagan & Julie Zhuo*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical requirements for the NounHub backend system. The backend will support a Twitter-like social platform with department-based forums for the National Open University community, built on AWS Serverless architecture.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Architecture
- **Approach**: Serverless, Monorepo
- **Framework**: Pulumi with TypeScript
  - Provides excellent type safety and IDE support
  - Enables infrastructure as code with full TypeScript capabilities
- **Environments**:
  - Development (dev)
    - For local development and testing
    - Reduced capacity and costs
    - Quick deployment cycles
  - Staging
    - Production-like environment for testing
    - Feature validation and integration testing
    - Data isolation from production
  - Production (prod)
    - Live environment for end users
    - Full capacity and redundancy
    - Strict deployment controls

### AWS Services

#### Core Services
- AWS Lambda for serverless compute
- API Gateway for RESTful endpoints
- DynamoDB for data storage
- Cognito for authentication
- S3 for file storage
- CloudFront for content delivery

## API Requirements

### Authentication
- Email-based registration and login
- Social authentication options
- Password reset functionality
- JWT token-based authorization

### Users
- Profile management
- User search and discovery
- Privacy settings

### Posts
- Create, read, update, delete operations
- Media attachment support
- Engagement metrics

### Forums
- Department-based organization
- Thread management
- Moderation capabilities

## Security Requirements

- AWS IAM best practices
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- CORS policies

## Scalability Considerations

- Auto-scaling configuration
- Performance optimization
- Cost management
- Monitoring and alerting

## Development Guidelines

- Infrastructure as Code using Pulumi with TypeScript
  - Separate Pulumi stacks for dev, staging, and prod environments
  - Environment-specific configuration management
  - Shared components and resources across stacks
- API documentation
- Testing strategy
  - Unit tests for each environment
  - Integration tests in staging
  - Load testing in staging to simulate production load
- CI/CD pipeline
  - Automated deployments to dev environment
  - Manual approval gates for staging and production
  - Rollback capabilities for all environments
- Code quality standards
  - Environment-specific security policies
  - Resource tagging standards
  - Cost allocation tracking
